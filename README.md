## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology
- Is an iterative and flexible approach to software development. It emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases.

  Advantages
  1) Flexibility: Agile is designed to accommodate changes in requirements, even late in the development process.
  2) Customer Involvement: Regular feedback loops ensure that the product aligns with customer needs and expectations.

  Disadvantages.
  1) Requires High Level of Collaboration: Agile requires close collaboration among team members, customers, and stakeholders, which can be challenging if not managed properly.
  2) Uncertainty in Planning: Due to its flexible nature, it can be challenging to predict timelines and budgets accurately.
 
Waterfall methodology
- Is a linear, sequential approach to software development. It follows a fixed sequence of phases: requirements gathering, design, implementation, verification (testing), and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, with minimal overlap.

  Advantages
  1. Clear Structure: The sequential nature of Waterfall provides a clear structure and timeline for the project.
  2. Predictability: Projects with well-defined requirements and scopes can benefit from Waterfall's predictability in terms of timeline and budget.
     
Disadvantages of Waterfall:
 1. Inflexibility: Once a phase is completed, it's difficult and costly to go back and make changes.
 2. Limited Customer Involvement: Customer involvement is often limited to the initial requirements phase, leading to potential misalignment between customer expectations and the final product.
 3. Late Testing: Testing happens late in the cycle, which can lead to significant issues being discovered only after most of the work is done.
    
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
In Agile:
1. Complex Projects with Changing Requirements
2. High risk Projects
